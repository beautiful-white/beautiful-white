### 📝 Summary
I am **Roman**, I am **19** and I am from **Russia**. I am studying in the first year of applied computer science at **FEFU**. I'm a datascientist. My stack: Python, C++.
### 📚 Biography:
And so. If you want to know a little more about me, then I'll start. \
At **12 years**, I actively studied the creation of **minecraft servers ⛏️**, it even became my passion. \
At **13 years**, I found out that the college next to me was recruiting for **a college preparation course in programming 👨🏻‍💻**, and I successfully enrolled in it. I studied **Pascal** and **Delphi** on it. I wrote my first **console programs** and **desktop applications**. \
At **14 years**, I graduated from these courses and entered **the Yandex programming school 👨🏻‍💻** for studying **Python**. \
At **15 years**, I was expelled from this school due to poor academic performance (I was bored). \
At **16 years**, I started studying **C++** and reached the Olympiad level, after which I abandoned it, since I didn't really need it anywhere (**returned to Python**). Later I went to **a programming school 👨🏻‍💻**, organized by the government of my city. That's where **I became a team leader 👑 for the first time**. As a result, we reached the final of the team selection and took 🥈**2nd place among the best teams of the school**.  \
At **17 years**, I went back to **programming school 👨🏻‍💻**, just like at 16, where I became **a team leader 👑 again** and we took 🥈 **2nd** place again. After that, I got into **Yandex Lyceum** 👨🏻‍💻, where I **successfully completed the Big Data (Python) course 👨🏻‍💻**, taking **8th place among best students** and 🥉**3rd place among teams (where I was again a team leader 👑)**. \
At **18 years**, I graduated from **high school** 🎓, wrote the Unified State Exam for 227 points (very good) and entered the 1st year at FEFU.

**To be continued**...

### ❗ *Important clarifications:*
*Throughout the years I have been **writing Olympiads** in **programming** and **mathematics** and often **became the winner** (in **2021 I won the All-Russian Olympiad 🏆**); I **started Github in 2022**, so there are **no old projects here and there will not be** (despite their huge number).*
